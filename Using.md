# Using Portier

> __TODO__: Write a description of how this all works.

The Portier Broker's API is identical to [OpenID
Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)'s "[Implicit
Flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth)."

Until we get around to writing this up, consider reading the
[demo-rp](https://github.com/portier/demo-rp)'s source, especially
[server.py](https://github.com/portier/demo-rp/blob/master/server.py). It turns
out that OpenID Connect is actually pretty reasonable!
