# Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

The following policies apply to the Portier authentication service available at
https://broker.portier.io, which allows websites to verify users' email
addresses.

## No Warranty

Portier is a volunteer-run service provided "as is," without warranty of any
kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or that the
service is free of defects.

We make no guarantees as to the service's reliability, availability, stability,
or security.

Organizations that need assurances of stability and availability are encouraged
to run their own instance of this service.

## Privacy

When using the Portier service to sign into a website, your email address and
that website's URL will be transmitted to the service.

Your email address and target website URL will not intentionally be disclosed
to third parties, except as necessary to facilitate address verification,
website sign-in, or operational monitoring of the service.

For example:

- We must disclose your email address to the website you're signing into so it
  can complete the sign-in process.

- We must either send you an email that includes the website URL you're signing
  into, or we must disclose your email address to a federated service (e.g.,
  Google Sign-In for Gmail users) so we can verify your access to that email
  address.

- We may log interactions with the Portier service in order to measure latency,
  error rates, implement request limits, or similar. These logs may be stored
  in a database or log aggregation service hosted by a third party.

Your email address, target website URL, IP address, browser headers, and
similar information may incidentally appear in logs kept by our upstream
service providers. We do not separately retain these logs.
