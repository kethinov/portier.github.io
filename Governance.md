# Portier Open Source Project Governance

Portier's governance structure is modeled after [AMP]'s. It is as follows:

* There is a single Tech Lead, who will have the final say on all decisions
  regarding technical direction.

* The Tech Lead directs the Core Committers, whose members include the Tech
  Lead and those who have been appointed by the Tech Lead as Core Committers.

* In the event the Tech Lead is unable to perform his or her duties, or
  abdicates, the Core Committers can select a new Tech Lead from amongst
  themselves.

## Core Committers:

* Tech Lead: St√©phan Kochen ([Keybase](https://keybase.io/stephank))
* Malte Paskuda ([Keybase](https://keybase.io/onli))
